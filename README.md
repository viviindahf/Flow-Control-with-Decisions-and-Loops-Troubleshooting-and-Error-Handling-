## For
For is a function that can loop over each type of variable in the form of a collection or sequence (list, string, or range).

## Else After For
The else function after for is a function that takes precedence over search loops to provide a way out of the program when the search is not found

## Nested Loop
A nested loop is a loop inside the body of the outer loop. The inner or outer loop can be any type, such as a while loop or for loop. For example, the outer for loop can contain a while loop and vice versa.

## While
While in Python is used to execute statements as long as the condition as long as the test expression (condition) is true. The condition can be any expression and includes all non-zero values. When the condition becomes False, the program will continue to the line after the statement block.

## Break
The break statement ends the loop containing it. Program control flows to the statement immediately after the loop body. If the break statement is inside a nested loop (a loop inside another loop), the break statement ends the loop according to the level or in which loop it is.

## Continue
The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code (statement) inside a loop for the current iteration only. 

## Pass
The pass statement is a null(empty) operation, nothing happens when the pass is executed. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.

## List Comprehension
List comprehensions are used for creating new lists from other iterables like tuples, strings, arrays, lists, etc. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing the expression, which is executed for each element along with the for loop to iterate over each element. 

# Troubleshooting and Error Handling
1. Syntax Errors : It usually happens when python does not understand what you are commanding and generally in people are still just learning python.
2. Exception : An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

## Function
A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. Python functions return a value using a return statement, if one is specified. A function can be called anywhere after the function has been declared.

## Return
Return expression will make program execution exit the function

## Pass by reference vs value
All parameters (arguments) in the python language are "passed by reference". This means that when we change a variable, the data that refers to it will also change, both inside the function and outside the calling function.

## Arguments
Arguments that can be passed to the function.
